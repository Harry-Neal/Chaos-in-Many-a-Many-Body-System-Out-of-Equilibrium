# Chaos in Many a Many Body System Out of Equilibrium
This repository contains the data and code used to generate the figures in my Master's dissertation.
The code simlates a Classical Heisenberg Spin chain with nearest neighbour interactions and anisotropic coupling.

# Structure of Repository
* Source C++ code used for the numerical simulations in `Code`.
* Code for data collection and plotting of the figures in the paper in `Figures`.
* Code for the next nearest neigbour interactions in  `Nest Nearest Neighbour`.
* Extra data not used for the figures, is higly unorganised, in  `Addition data`
* The dissertation itself is in `Paper`.

## Acknowledgments
* Thanks to Thomas Vennes for making the basis for this code available at: https://github.com/tveness/spinchain-papers
