# Chaos-in-Many-a-Many-Body-System-Out-of-Equilibrium
A 4th Year project at the University of Nottingham.

The code simulates a classical Heisenberg spin chain with nearest neighbour interactions. The systemm is prepared in equilibruim and then a perturbing field is applied. Out of time order correlators are then measured.
